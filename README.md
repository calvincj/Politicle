# Politicle 🎮🌍

Politicle is an online political guessing game inspired by Wordle.  
Each round, players try to identify a hidden country using clues about:

- 🏛️ Liberal Democracy Index  
- 💰 GDP per Capita  
- 👥 Population  

Players click on countries on an interactive map to guess. After each guess, the game tells you whether the target country is higher, lower, or similar on each measure. You can also reveal a hint about the government type.
